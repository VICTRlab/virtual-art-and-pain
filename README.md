## File strucuture
### `javascript/` 

- Contains all files pertaining to the frontend and data collection. 

- Note: Collected data flows from the unity app --> javascript app --> database. So if you need to modify anything pertaining to how data is written to the db, it's likely you only need to modify files within `javascript/`.

### `unity/` 

- Contains all files pertaining to the museum itself, i.e. the unity project and associated assets. 

- Data flows out of the unity app into the javascript app. The unity app itself has no ability to write to the db.
